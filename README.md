# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
## Dataset:
The dataset is fetched from official Website of INI benchmark website
https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html
### About the Dataset:  
The Dataset is German Traffic Sign Benchmark consists of approximately 50,000 images and 43 classes.  
Based on the data, This project comes under the category of multi-class, single-image classification problem.
## Motivation

### Driver Support Systems
It can be used as a tool to automatically limit the speed of the car,
transmit a warning signal for exceeding the speed limit, deter or restrict illegal actions,
or alert the driver earlier to the presence of a sign.

### Highway maintenance

To check the existence and status of the signs today, a human operator must watch a recording.
It is a tiresome work since the operator must pay close attention and because the signs occasionally occur.
## Summary
1. The photos are given to a Deep Learning model that uses
TensorFlow to create a DCNN Net (Deep Convolutional Neural Network/ConvNet).
2. TensorFlow is a deep learning model that is commonly utilized in 
applications today for image recognition while processing picture data.

3. So it makes sense to use DCNN using PyTorch.

4. In the research study, a Deep Convolutional Neural network was proposed.
Finding the right CNN model with the right number of hidden layers will aid in obtaining highly accurate results.
